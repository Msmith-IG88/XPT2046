This project demonstrates the integration of a ili9342 LCD Display and an xpt2046 Touch Controller through a Nexys A7 FPGA board embedded with the MicroBlaze processor. My goal was to design and create an efficient SPI communication interface to process touch and display data accurately and efficiently. The project as a whole, provides details of how to interface FPGAs with interactive hardware components like the display and touch controllers used. It can be applied to many different touch-screen devices and embedded systems not only through its development but also how it was tested.
